            <li>The calculator's accuracy depends on the inputs provided by the customer. Incomplete or inaccurate inputs will lead to inaccuracy or bias in the results. Furthermore, there may be other factors which are not taken into account by the tool, but which may be relevant to defining or achieving the customer's goals</li>
            <li>Investing is inherently risky. While the Financial Goal Simulator assumes that on average, the portfolio grows at the expected rate of return for that asset allocation, the actual performance for any given year may be significantly greater or less than this average rate. In addition, there is always the possibility of unexpected events (e.g. 2008 Financial Crisis, Covid-19), which may cause a sudden extreme fall in the value of the portfolio.</li>
            <li>All estimates – whether it is the user’s own inputs, the calculation of the goal target amount, or the projection of future investment outcomes – are subject to estimation error. For this reason, it is important for the user to always be conservative when making their own estimates.</li>

        <p class="card-text">
          <ol>
            <li>The goal target amount is only an estimate based on the information provided by the customer, and is not a guarantee that this amount will be adequate to meet the customer's future needs. The customer is responsible for independently verifying for themselves the actual amount that they will need to meet the goal.</li>
            <li>It is assumed that the initial upfront savings amount as well as monthly savings are kept inside the portfolio that is dedicated to that goal, up to the target date. Customers should ensure that they have sufficient holding power or protection (e.g. insurance) to avoid liquidating or selling off the portfolio before their target date due to unexpected events</li>
            <li>For a given asset allocation, the expected risk and return of the portfolio are estimated based on the long-term historical risk and return of a set of benchmark indexes that represent each asset class. Note that as these estimates are based on historical risk and return, they may not necessarily repeat in the future. It is assumed that the average value of the portfolio grows at the same expected rate of return every year. Any earnings (e.g. dividends or interest) are also assumed to be reinvested and to grow at this same average rate. </li>
            <li>Customer will save the monthly investment amount from the current date up until, and including, the age of retirement. After that, they will stop further savings and instead drawdown their monthly expense amount every month until the end of the estimated life.</li>
